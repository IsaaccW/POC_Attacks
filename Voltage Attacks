I will be demonstrating the proof of concept of our voltage glitching circuit, it is essentially just a high powered MOSFET switching the device
between VCC and ground. However it is possible to make this stronger by soldering multiple MOSFETs together, and more precise by choosing a 
specific trigger signal.

  My first test was a simple counter incrementing i:
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);

}
  int i = 0;
void loop() {
  i++;
  delay(500);
  Serial.println(i);
}
Printing results simply showed: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...
I used a 100Hz singal at 7Vpp and connected the drain of my mosfet to a pin()()()())()() on the Arduino Mega.
The first result I was able to replicate is restarting the device as seen below
